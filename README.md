# Description
This is a DSL project for generating different fractal images. 
We can construct fractals by introducing the idea of initiators and generators. An initiator is a starting shape. A generator is an arranged collection of scaled copies of the initiator. To generate fractals from initiators and generators, we follow a simple rule called 
# Fractal Generation Rule:
At each step, replace every copy of the initiator with a scaled copy of the generator, rotating as necessary.  We can see this rule applied in following example:
In this program you will generate different types of fractals, which are: box fractal (1),
