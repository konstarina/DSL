# DSL

## Description
This is a DSL project for generating different fractal images. 
We can construct fractals by introducing the idea of *initiators* and *generators*. An initiator is a starting shape. A generator is an arranged collection of scaled copies of the initiator. To generate fractals from initiators and generators, we follow a simple rule called ***Fractal Generation Rule: At each step, replace every copy of the initiator with a scaled copy of the generator, rotating as necessary.***  We can see this rule applied in following example:
In this program you will generate different types of fractals, which are: 
box fractal (1),
cross form (2),
crystal (3), 
Koch snowflake (4), 
Levy cyrve (5), 
Peano-Gosper curve (6), 
quadratic Koch island (7), 
quadratic snowflake (8), 
rings (9), 
Sierpinsky sieve (10), 
Sierpinsky arrowhead (11), 
snowflake (12)
