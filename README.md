# DSL

## Description
	This is a DSL project for generating different fractal images. 
We can construct fractals by introducing the idea of *initiators* and *generators*. An initiator is a starting shape. A generator is an arranged collection of scaled copies of the initiator. To generate fractals from initiators and generators, we follow a simple rule called   > ***Fractal Generation Rule: At each step, replace every copy of the initiator with a scaled copy of the generator, rotating as necessary.***  We can see this rule applied in following example:
In this program you will generate different types of fractals, which are: 
- box fractal (1),
- cross form (2),
- crystal (3), 
- Koch snowflake (4), 
- Levy cyrve (5), 
- Peano-Gosper curve (6), 
- quadratic Koch island (7), 
- quadratic snowflake (8), 
- rings (9), 
- Sierpinsky sieve (10), 
- Sierpinsky arrowhead (11), 
- snowflake (12)

## Prerequisites

## Installation 
Using the command line, desired fractal image is generated.
```python
  from __future__ import print_function
  import sys
  import importlib
  ```

The source file is the 1st argument to the script:

```python if len(sys.argv) != 2:
	 print('usage: %s <src.dsl>' % sys.argv[0])
	 sys.exit(1) 
```

Path to the Library (DSL -Library) containing fractal programs:

```python sys.path.insert(0, r'C:\Users\Пользователь\PycharmProjects\DSL-Library')
```

Read the .dsl file. Define % symbol as comment keyword and ignore the input after it. Split the input into tokens(parts):
```python with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as file:
	> for line in file:
    	> line = line.strip()
    	> if not line or line[0] == '%':
        	> continue
    	> parts = line.split()
    	> print(parts)
```

Define the first token as the module. A module(like "koch") is the name of a .py file that generates the fractal(after getting the arguments):

 ```python mod = importlib.import_module(parts[0])
 ```
      
Parsing the module name, function to be called(usually "draw") and arguments(parts[2] - axiom, part[3]):
```python getattr(mod, parts[1])(parts[2], parts[3])
```

> To generate a fractal type in the .dsl file , User should introduce following instructions:
        1 - Name of  desired Fractal
        2 - Action to be done (draw)
        3 - Axiom
        4 - Rule

>> boxFractal draw F-F-F-F F-F+F+F-F

To run the program, User should type in the Command Line of his device : 
```python python nameOfThisFile.py nameOfDSLfile.dsl
```
